# clid

Clid is a command line app to manage your mp3 files' id3v2 tags. I love [cmus](https://github.com/cmus/cmus), and tried to find 
something similar for editing the tags. None of them could do what I want - edit them in an interface similar to cmus(ncurses
based). So I came up with clid. I'm still working on the basics.

This project is made with [npyscreen](https://bitbucket.org/npcole/npyscreen), a python wrapper around ncurses, making it easier
to craft command line apps.
